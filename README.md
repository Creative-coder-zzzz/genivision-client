📝 How It Works
1. User Authentication
Users must sign up or log in to access image generation features.

Auth is secured using industry best practices with Express and JWT.

2. Credit System
Each new user is granted 5 free image generation credits.

Every image generation request consumes 1 credit.

Once the free credits are exhausted, users are prompted to purchase additional credits to continue.

3. Image Generation Flow
After logging in, users:

Enter a text prompt (e.g., "A futuristic city in the clouds").

Click the "Generate Now" button.

The backend sends the request to the ClipDrop API.

The generated image is returned and displayed in the UI.

⚙️ Developer Notes
ClipDrop API has 100 initial credits, monitor usage and upgrade as needed.

Credit logic is enforced in both frontend and backend to avoid abuse.

Ensure that prompts are validated and sanitized before sending to the API.
